Waiting Time:

    Definition: The duration a process spends in the ready queue waiting for CPU execution.
    Starts: Accumulates from the moment a process arrives in the system until it begins execution.
    Impact: Directly affects system responsiveness and resource utilization efficiency.
    Factors: Influenced by scheduling algorithms and process characteristics such as arrival time and burst time.
    Measurement: Calculated as the difference between the time a process starts execution and its arrival time.
    Importance: Longer waiting times increase resource wastage and delay process completion, impacting overall system performance.
    Optimization: Efficient scheduling algorithms prioritize processes to minimize waiting times and improve system throughput.

Turnaround Time:

    Definition: Total time taken from the submission of a process to its completion, including waiting and execution times.
    Comprehensive Measure: Reflects overall system responsiveness and efficiency in servicing processes.
    Calculation: Difference between completion time and arrival time of a process.
    Factors: Waiting time directly contributes to turnaround time, alongside actual execution time.
    System Performance Indicator: Longer turnaround times indicate inefficient resource management and scheduling.
    Optimization: Improved by reducing waiting times through effective scheduling strategies.
    Objective: Minimize turnaround time to enhance user satisfaction and system efficiency.
